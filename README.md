# office_cash_book

I developed a Office Cashbook App using Flutter.

As a Flutter Developer, I think that State Management is a Core of Flutter. And For State Management, I used GetX Library and BLoC Pattern Together. For creating a Custom PDF as a Personal Passbook, I used a pdf package and printing package to store that PDF in the device storage.

Packages Used :
